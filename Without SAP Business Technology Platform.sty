Without SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) licenses or SAP HANA Spatial Services, you can still integrate third-party GIS services (like HERE, PTV, or ALK PC*MILER) into SAP Transportation Management (TM) by using direct API calls via middleware or custom ABAP development. SAP TM provides an open GIS integration framework designed for this purpose. 
Here is how to use third-party GIS services without BTP:
1. Direct Integration via Middleware (Recommended Approach) 
Instead of routing through SAP BTP, connect your third-party GIS provider directly to your SAP backend. 
Method: Use SAP Process Integration/Process Orchestration (PI/PO) or SAP Integration Suite to create a bridge between the GIS provider’s API and SAP TM.
Functionality: This allows for geocoding (converting addresses to latitude/longitude), georouting (calculating distance/duration), and map display.
Implementation: The GIS provider supplies APIs, which your middleware calls, transforms, and sends to SAP TM via RFC or web services. 
2. Custom ABAP Development (Direct to Provider) 
You can directly call web services from within your ABAP environment. 
Custom Class Development: Create a custom ABAP class by copying the standard GIS connector class (/SCMB/CL_GEOROUTING_CONNECTOR) and modify it to handle the REST/SOAP API calls for your chosen vendor.
Process Controller Configuration: Use the Process Controller (SPRO) to configure this new method for distance and duration determination.
Data Transport: Use HTTP client functionality within ABAP (e.g., CL_HTTP_CLIENT) to send request data to the vendor and parse the response. 
3. Setup Steps in SAP TM (No BTP)
Define GIS Provider: In SPRO, define your GIS provider (e.g., HERE, PTV) in the "Define GIS Tool" section.
Establish Connectivity: Configure the necessary TCP/IP connections (SM59) to point directly to the vendor's API endpoints instead of a BTP URL.
Assign to Means of Transport: In the "Define Means of Transport" customizing, assign the new GIS tool to the relevant transport types, including configuring mapping for speed (low, medium, high) and distances. 
4. Alternative: Manual or Basic Setup
If a full integration is too complex, you can operate with limited, non-third-party GIS capabilities: 
Manual Coordinates: Maintain geo-coordinates for locations directly in the location master data.
Straight Line Calculation: Utilize SAP’s standard air-line distance calculation (as the crow flies) instead of road-based routing. 
Summary of Requirements
Licensing: You must have a direct contract/license with the third-party GIS provider (BYOL - Bring Your Own License).
API Credentials: You must have the API keys and endpoints from the provider to configure in SAP TM.
Security: Ensure secure, authenticated connections are configured directly between SAP and the provider's server.
